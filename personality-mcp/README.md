python mcp_personality_server.py
```

## üí° Usage Examples

### Basic Consultation
```bash
# Consult the Creative personality
echo '{"jsonrpc": "2.0", "id": 1, "method": "tools/call", "params": {"name": "consult_personality", "arguments": {"personality": "creative", "question": "How can we make our login page more engaging?"}}}' | python mcp_personality_server.py
```

### Team Consensus
```bash
# Get team consensus on a decision
echo '{"jsonrpc": "2.0", "id": 1, "method": "tools/call", "params": {"name": "get_team_consensus", "arguments": {"topic": "Database choice", "details": "Should we use PostgreSQL or MongoDB for our user data?"}}}' | python mcp_personality_server.py
```

### Session Management
```bash
# Start a collaborative session
echo '{"jsonrpc": "2.0", "id": 1, "method": "tools/call", "params": {"name": "start_collaborative_session", "arguments": {"topic": "New Product Launch", "initial_request": "Plan the launch strategy for our new mobile app"}}}' | python mcp_personality_server.py
```

## üìä Resources

The server provides several resources for accessing personality and session information:

- **personality://[personality_type]**: Access individual personality states
- **session://current**: Current collaborative session information
- **session://history**: Complete interaction history

## üîç Monitoring

The server logs all activities to `mcp_server.log` for debugging and monitoring purposes.

## üõ†Ô∏è Configuration

The server runs on stdio by default (MCP standard). All personalities are initialized automatically when the server starts.

## üìù Example Workflow

1. **Start a session**: Begin with `start_collaborative_session`
2. **Consult personalities**: Use `consult_personality` for specific expertise
3. **Get feedback**: Use `personality_feedback` for proposal evaluation
4. **Assign tasks**: Use `assign_task` for implementation
5. **Check status**: Use `get_personality_status` to monitor progress

## üß™ Testing

The server includes demo responses for each personality type. In a production environment, you would integrate with actual LLM APIs to generate dynamic responses.

## ü§ù Contributing

This is a demonstration MCP server. To extend it:

1. Add new personality types to the `PersonalityType` enum
2. Implement corresponding response generation logic
3. Add new tools for additional functionality
4. Integrate with real LLM APIs for dynamic responses

## üîó MCP Protocol

This server implements the Model Context Protocol (MCP) specification, making it compatible with MCP clients like Claude Desktop, N8N, and other MCP-compatible tools.
